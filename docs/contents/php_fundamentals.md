- PHP supports a wide range of databases
- PHP is free. Download it from the official PHP resource: www.php.net
- PHP is easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side

## What Do I Need?
  
To start using PHP, you can:

- Find a web host with PHP and MySQL support
- Install a web server on your own PC, and then install PHP and MySQL

## Use a Web Host With PHP Support

If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.

Just create some .php files, place them in your web directory, and the server will automatically parse them for you.

You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.

Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.

## Set Up PHP on Your Own PC

However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:

- install a web server
- install PHP
- install a database, such as MySQL
- OR install XAMPP (most popular PHP Development Environment)

!> XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Get installer here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php
